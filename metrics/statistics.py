"""
Samples are typically generated from a RV distribution in order to compute some quantities that are useful such
as marginals, confidence intervals, probability of events or expected value. By measuring the error on this statistics
by using the approximated samples and the ground truth values, the quality of sampling algorithms can be assessed.
